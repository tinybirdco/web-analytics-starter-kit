DESCRIPTION >
    Summary with general KPIs per date, including visits, page views, bounce rate and average session duration.
    Accepts `date_from` and `date_to` date filter, all historical data if not passed.
    Set `include_previous_period=true` to get previous period metrics and growth percentage.
    Daily granularity, except when filtering one single day (hourly)
