# How do I make a contribution?

We are happy to receive pull requests contributions from the community. New features, improvements to the existing ones, minor fixes, quality code related tasks... anything else that raises the bar of the project.

Branching strategy:

- Create a new branch, using these prefixes: `feature/`, `doc/`, `bugfix/`, etc.
- Set `main` as target.

Every pull request must comply all of the following:

- Motivation and description (with technical details).
- Successful functional validation.
- Successful build status.
- No merge conflicts.
- No dependencies conflicts.
- Follow code style guide.
- All tests passing.
- Updated README and CHANGELOG if applies.

If you have any doubt, please contact the maintainers.
